Installing & configuring mattata is very simple. Clone the repository using `git clone git://github.com/wrxck/mattata.git`. Then, run the appropriate installation script located inside mattata/install/.
You'll need sudo access to be able to install the dependencies required. Then, you need to fill in the values in configuration.example.lua. After you've done that, rename configuration.example.lua to configuration.lua, and use ./launch.sh to start your bot.

Arguments enclosed in [square brackets] are optional, and arguments enclosed in are required.

You will notice there is a "Flag" column. This is a number which indicated what rights the user must have in order to use the corresponding command(s). Below is a table which explains what each number means:

| Flag | Name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | User          | All users are in this flag by default. It simply means they exist. This is the lowest flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 2    | Moderator     | This flag contains all people of the moderator rank and higher. Moderators are non-official admins who have access to administrative commands, such as /ban, /kick and /unban. Moderators are granted this rank when an administrator replies to their message with /mod or /promote.             |
| 3    | Administrator | This flag contains all of the official group administrators. These are all of the people who have been promoted to an administrator by the creator of the group/channel. These people will have a star displayed next to their name in the member list on your client.                            |
| 4    | Owner         | This is a small category containing only the users who are in the admins array of the configuration.lua file. This rank means that the user has access to owner commands such as /bash and /lua, and can control the bot using /reload. This is the highest flag.                               |

All permissions levels are hereditary - meaning a user in flag 3 is also in flags 1 & 2.
